                    <p class="col-sm-12 company-subdesc">Danny Allen founded NuTech, Inc. in 1989. Danny, a 1980
                        graduate of
                        the
                        University of
                        Houston College of Pharmacy, recognized an opportunity to fill a vital need
                        in
                        the East Texas healthcare marketplace while working for a national nuclear
                        pharmacy chain in the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex area. With commitments
                        from a
                        few hospitals in the Tyler/Longview area, he and his wife, Georganne, opened
                        the
                        business in a small, leased space in an office building, and delivered the
                        first
                        radiopharmaceutical doses in August of 1989. Since then, the company has
                        grown
                        steadily, adding additional pharmacists and support personnel, and moving
                        into a
                        new, state-of-the-art building in 1993.<br>
                        NuTech Inc.'s service area expanded in April of 1999 when Danny
                        opened a new
                        pharmacy

                        again

                                    Houston College of Pharmacy, recognized an opportunity to fill a vital need
                                    in
                                    the East Texas healthcare marketplace while working for a national nuclear
                                    pharmacy chain in the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex area. With commitments
                                    from a
                                    few hospitals in the Tyler/Longview area, he and his wife, Georganne, opened
                                    the
                                    business in a small, leased space in an office building, and delivered the
